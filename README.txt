The Ball Platform Core
----------------------
- Preparations for configuration-guided deployment are being done.
- TODO: Automated/configuration support for the list below...

For Azure-familiar architects who want to deploy already 
- contact me and I'll assist (kalle.launiala@protonit.net).

The steps to do are following:
- Revisit the TheBallAzureConfiguration.sln 
- The configuration files in full cloud deployment are the ones that apply
- Configure the certificate(s) for WebAccelerators
- Deploy the websites using Visual Studio
- Deploy the worker roles from bin\
- Revisit the WebInterface\InstanceConfig.settings - see examples of committed ones
- Deploy from OIPTemplates - repository the "publiclanding" manually under "about"
- Run WebTemplateManager to upload system templates for account/group
